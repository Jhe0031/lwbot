## What is it?
~~It's the Christmas present for that server xD I'll be developing it up until Christmas then release it to the server. After that, who knows what'll happen? -shrug-~~ Well, Christmas is here and gone, and the bot has been released to the server. They seem to like it, which is good! We had a few bumps here and there, but we finally got a stable version pushed.

## Can I have one?
...Sure? Make sure you have [Node.js](http://node.js.org/) installed o.o It's writen in Javascript.

## It's broke. What do?
Open up an issue [here](http://github.com/jennasisis/lwbot/issues).

## I have suggestion. What do?
Open up a [pull request](http://github.com/jennasisis/lwbot/pulls) and I'll get to it when I can.

## Did you create other stuff?
Yes! Yes indeed, I did. I created [AkiiBot](http://github.com/jennasisis/AkiiBot), a multipurpose Discord bot. I'm also working on a rewrite to that shitty code, (creatively named) [Akiibot Rewrite](http://github.com/jennasisis/akiibot-rewrite)
