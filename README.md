## What is it?
It's a bot made by myself and [Nen](http://github.com/SpacemannFinn) to do various things around the server; memes, currency, RSS webtoon links, and more. We hope to eventually replace every bot on the server with this one.

## Can I have one?
Sure! Make sure you have [Node](http://nodejs.org) installed.

## It's broke. What do?
Open up an issue [here](http://github.com/jennasisis/lwbot/issues), or PM me on Discord: Akii#0008

## I have suggestion. What do?
Open up a [pull request](http://github.com/jennasisis/lwbot/pulls) and I'll get to it when I can, or PM me on Discord: Akii#0008

## Did you create other stuff?
Yes, I did. I created [AkiiBot](http://github.com/jennasisis/AkiiBot), a multipurpose Discord bot. I'm also working on a rewrite to that spaghetti code, (creatively named) [Akiibot Rewrite](http://github.com/jennasisis/akiibot-rewrite).
