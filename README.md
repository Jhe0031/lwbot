# LINE WEBTOON Bot
This is a bot created for the [fan-made LINE WEBTOON Discord server](https://discord.gg/bQSYxqF).

# What is it?
It's the Christmas present for that server xD I'll be developing it up until Christmas then release it to the server. After that, who knows what'll happen? \*shrug*

# Can I have one?
...Sure? Make sure you have [Node.js](http://node.js.org/) installed o.o It's writen in Javascript.

# It's broke. What do?
Open up an issue [here](http://github.com/jennasisis/lwbot/issues).

# I have suggestion. What do?
Open up a [pull request](http://github.com/jennasisis/lwbot/pulls) and I'll get to it when I can.

# Did you create other stuff?
Yes! Yes indeed, I did. I created [AkiiBot](http://github.com/jennasisis/AkiiBot), a multipurpose Discord bot.
